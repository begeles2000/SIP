<P>This is a modified versions of the relay_board plugin. It is designed for use with 
Raspberry Pi models with a 40 pin GPIO header.</P>
<p>The diagram below shows the GPIO pin header and indicates the pins to use with this plugin.</p>



<p> You can use a relay board with 1, 2, 4 or 6 relays or a combination of those up to 6 relays.</p><br>
<p><b>Caution:</b> when using more than 1 relay board, the boards must all be either low-level trigger or all high-level trigger. You can not mix the trigger types.</p><br>
<p>Connect the board(s) to the Raspberry Pi following the channel numbering indicated in blue on the diagram. For example, if you are
connecting a 1 channel relay board and a 4 channel board, connect the first board starting with pin 18 on the Pi and continue with pins 22, 24, 26, 32 and 36.
The relays will then operate as stations 1 through 6.<br>

			The 5V and ground pins on the Pi can be used to power 1 or 2 relay boards. If more boards are being used or if more than a couple of relays will be turned on at the same time It is a good idea to use a separate power supply to power the boards.</li><br>
