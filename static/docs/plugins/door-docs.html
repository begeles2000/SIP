<P>This plugin is designed to operate a garage door and read its current status from a sensor</P>
<p>The sensor used is a magnetic reed switch mounted on the door.</p>
<p>The plugin is prepared to enable 2 types of door actuation (full open and pedestrian open) that seem to be the standard.<br>
To do this it operates 2 relays one is switched with the FULL open button and the other one is switched with the SEMI open button.<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The full open relay is operated from pin 38 (GPIO 20)</li>
<li>The semi open relay is operated from pin 40 (GPIO 21)</li>
<ul>

<p>The sensor must be wired to pin 19 (GPIO 10)</p>
